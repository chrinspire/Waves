**Another Weird New Chess Algorithm**  
- it uses recursive min-max/alpha-beta tree search, but never generates the chessboards along the search tree  
- move decisions are based on data explored and deducted on the current board plus the effects moves have on the board 
(without ever unfolding or bitcoding etc. the board layout after the moves being evaluated)  
- while the neighbouring project [TideEval](https://github.com/chrinspire/TideEval) uses mostly rule based pattern recognition of situations on the 
board, Waves focuses on current moves and their relations.
